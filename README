Week One Code Challenge: Toy Problems 

Description

The three wrritten programs are solutions to three challenges that I was worked on. The challanges are as listed below.

Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator 

Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond the correct grade, as shown below: 

        A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.



CHallenge 2: Speed Detector 

Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

   > For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.



Challenge 3: Speed Detector 

Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary.

Set Up Instructions:

Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator

For the first challenge, the program requires you to insert your marks on and you will recieve a grade according to your marks.



Challenge 2: Speed Detector 

Here, the program requires the speed to be inserted, then it prints either "Ok", "License suspended" or the number of demerits depending with the speed inserted.



Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator

This program takes the basic salary that has been inputed and deducts the necessary decuctions; tax, NHIF and NSSF, providing you the amount of net salary of the basic salary entered.
